### Hi there 👋

I made few simple and quiet interesting games using mainly JavaScript like: [dratewka](https://github.com/Mrozu888/dratewka) or [missile command](https://github.com/Mrozu888/missile_command)

🌱 I’m currently learning IT tools here to improve group working skills.

🔭 I’m currently working on our group project named Pacrats game.
